# machine-learning-project-natural-language-processing-
spam mail classifier

This code is a machine learning project that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to detect spam messages. The project includes data cleaning and preprocessing, train-test split, training the model, and evaluating its accuracy. The code reads data from a file named "SMSSpamCollection", which is a tab-separated file containing a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam).

The code first cleans and preprocesses the data by removing special characters and converting the messages to lowercase. It also tokenizes the messages, removes stop words, and lemmatizes the remaining words. After preprocessing, the code uses the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn to convert the messages into a matrix of token counts. The code then splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.

The code trains a Naive Bayes classifier on the training data and uses it to make predictions on the testing data. It then evaluates the accuracy of the model by computing a confusion matrix and the overall accuracy score.

The code is intended to be run in a Python environment with the necessary dependencies installed, including pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and nltk. The README file for the project should provide instructions on how to run the code and install any required dependencies. The README file should also provide an overview of the project, including its purpose, methodology, and results.
